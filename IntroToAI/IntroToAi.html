                An AI learns from its Learning model. A learning Model uses
                one or more algorithms to find patterns in a given data set. Once it finds patterns in a data set, it will then train the AI to find those patterns.
                After the training is done, the AI will then be able to, by itself, find certain patterns in data that you give it and make predictions based on the data.
