            Deep learning is structured to mimic the human brain. Enabling AI to find patterns in unstructured data.
            While Deep learning is a branch of Machine Learning, it is capable of more complex tasks, and most AIs that people think of use Deep Learning.

                In a Artifial Neural Network, layers of interconnected nodes are called Neurons, and these neurons work together
                to process and learn from given data.
