        <p>When entering the contest, I wonder what I would do for my entry, and I decided to make a website. After I decided what I wanted to make, I had to figure out what I
        would put on my website.

    <div id = "why">
        <p> I decided that the way in which I would touch the topic of AI Authenticity, would be to create a website that would touch simple concepts in regards to AI
            so that people who don't know much about AI, or let alone about computers,  would be able to understand. I would also add little snippets indicating flaws that AI is susceptible to.

    <div id = "extra">
        <p> I created the website by researching basic concepts about AI, some of the sources that I used will be shown.
            Some of my knowledge I got from prior research in regards to the ethicality of AI and from reading on the topic of Data Science and Statistics (Basic Introduction)
